 **Journey through the course.**
 
# *Stories*
 
 * [The Next Step]: Click on the word *take* in the last line. 

Takeaway:
The audience = the point of view = the narrator ---> The Narrative

 
#*Games*
 * [Braid]: Mechanics is emotional
 
 
#*Art*
 
Art =/= Design

#Similarities
 * [People Page]: First Programming exercise since making livejournal brown and enterprise software
 * [We Among Us]: Javascripting a platform, because platforms are ant farms with humans as ants and humans are interesting
 * [Aiutare]: Sharing Community platform, because sharing people are even more interesting.
 * Tranquility Systems: Nearables are awesome when you're a nearable too

The imagination is bounded by the fence of capability. Capability is a technical skill by definition, it is just not bounded by plexiglass. 
As such it became impractical to continue to original tranquility systems project as it was dependent for a far greater capability than I had. 


#Differences

There are none except possibly the dominant medium of transmitting the emotion or story to the audience
